# Statement
What is the smallest base larger than 2 in which the integer n contains only the digits 0 and 1?

# Input format
The first line of each input file contains the number t of test cases.
Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (in base 10).

# Output format
For each test case output a single line with a single number.
If n cannot be represented using 1s and 0s in any base larger than 2, output -1.
Otherwise, output an integer b: the smallest base larger than 2 in which nâ€™s representation contains only 1s and 0s.
